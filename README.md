This is a demo project to showcase the power of the new **View Transitions API** in CSS. The goal is to build a fully responsive photo gallery where the transition between the list view and the detail view is completely smooth and native-app-like, achieved **without a single line of JavaScript.**

## üéì Key Takeaways

This project was an excellent exercise in understanding the View Transitions API, particularly how to name elements (`view-transition-name`) to orchestrate multiple, simultaneous animations. It effectively demonstrates how complex and modern user experiences can be created using only the power of CSS, without relying on heavy JavaScript libraries.
